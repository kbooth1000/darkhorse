We’ll talk about what you do and don’t like about those photos/styles, as well as the intended use and the rooms where the custom work will be located. If you’ve created a sketch of what you have in mind, we’ll look at that, too.</p><p>Together, we’ll create a design that fits your needs and your desire for a one-of-a-kind creation. (Any architects and designers who are involved in your project will be part of this process as well, of course.)</p><p>After we’ve worked together to determine the design elements, Dark HorseWoodworks will provide a proposal stating the price and approximate delivery date.</p><p>We often have a backlog of projects that can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and we’ll always give you realistic expectations about timing. Unless otherwise stated, all price quotes include setup and installation.</p><p><strong>Payment</strong></p><p>We are pleased to accept cash, checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p><p><strong>Warranty</strong></p><p>We stand behind the products we create. Typically, our work is intended for normal indoor use. Should our furniture or cabinetry fail at any time during<br> the lifetime of the original owner because of issues with our workmanship or material, we will either repair or replace it at no cost.</p><p><strong>If you are interested in discussing a project, please fill out the form below:</strong></p><div id="contact-form-226"><form action="http://darkhorsewoodworks.com/dh1/about/working-with-dark-horse/#contact-form-226" method="post" class="contact-form commentsblock"><div class="grunion-field-wrap grunion-field-name-wrap"> <label for="g226-name" class="grunion-field-label name">Name<span>(required)</span></label> <input type="text" name="g226-name" id="g226-name" value="" class="name" required="" aria-required="true"></div><div class="grunion-field-wrap grunion-field-email-wrap"> <label for="g226-email" class="grunion-field-label email">Email<span>(required)</span></label> <input type="email" name="g226-email" id="g226-email" value="" class="email" required="" aria-required="true"></div><div class="grunion-field-wrap grunion-field-textarea-wrap"> <label for="contact-form-comment-g226-message" class="grunion-field-label textarea">Message<span>(required)</span></label><textarea name="g226-message" id="contact-form-comment-g226-message" rows="20" class="textarea" required="" aria-required="true"></textarea></div><p class="contact-submit"> <button type="submit" class="pushbutton-wide">Submit</button> <input type="hidden" id="_wpnonce" name="_wpnonce" value="bb5fde3253"><input type="hidden" name="_wp_http_referer" value="/dh1/about/working-with-dark-horse/"> <input type="hidden" name="contact-form-id" value="226"> <input type="hidden" name="action" value="grunion-contact-form"> <input type="hidden" name="contact-form-hash" value="f566c76d7ad03c88ae0b4e37d9419ee75cf35431"></p></form></div></div>`;
