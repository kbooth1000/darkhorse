We were proud to be recognized for our work, but the awards were also a great marketing tool for us. It’s powerful for potential clients to see that you’re doing work that is honored by others in the industry.”</p>\n<p>Chris soon took his involvement to a deeper level, attending events, participating in discussions on the online forum<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>and eventually joining the board in 2016.</p>\n<p><b>All-in</b></p>\n<p>Owning a small business is challenging and time-consuming, and taking on outside commitments is no small thing.</p>\n<p>But Chris sees the CMA time commitment and his growing leadership role as wise investments.

That’s not the way it works with the CMA. The best part of being in this group is the ability to draw on the knowledge of other members.”</p>\n<p>The CMA also provided Chris with an opportunity to develop another set of skills: Public speaking and what many in the business world call “thought leadership.” He has spoken at national industry conferences and CMA events about his experiences as a business owner, craftsman and entrepreneur.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>“It’s definitely rewarding to have started out as a novice and to have reached a point where I have knowledge to share with others who are just starting out or who may be changing gears,” he says. “I credit my CMA friends for helping me get to that point by sharing their hard-won expertise with me over the years, and I intend to keep paying it forward whenever I can.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-1696\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-1696\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-1696\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","title":"Chris Dehmer elected President of Cabinet Makers Association Board","slug":"chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board","author":{"node":{"name":"darkhorse"}},"featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board","content":"<p><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1697 alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190605_085045_01.jpg?resize=225%2C300\" alt=\"IMG_20190605_085045_01\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190605_085045_01.jpg?resize=300%2C400 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190605_085045_01.jpg?resize=1218%2C1624 1218w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190605_085045_01.jpg?resize=640%2C853 640w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190605_085045_01.jpg?resize=980%2C1307 980w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190605_085045_01.jpg?w=1960 1960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Dark Horse Woodworks&#8217; Chris Dehmer has been elected president of the Board of Directors of the Cabinet Makers Association (CMA), the industry group for professional cabinet makers and woodworkers in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>Chris previously served as an at-large board member for two years and as vice-president for one year.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>He joins newly elected vice-president James Fox, treasurer Matt Wehner and secretary Brian Clancy.
