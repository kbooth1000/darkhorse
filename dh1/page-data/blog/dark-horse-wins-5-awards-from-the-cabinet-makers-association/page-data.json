We’ve been fortunate to win Wood Diamond awards every year since we joined; these honors means so much because we know that our fellow cabinet makers truly understand the time and attention to detail that goes into every one of our projects.</p>\n<p>So you can imagine how excited we were when the CMA recognized Dark Horse with four first-place Wood Diamond awards and one third-place award at the CMA awards ceremony in Atlanta last week!</p>\n<p><b>So what is a Wood Diamond Award? </b></p>\n<p>The awards recognize cabinetry companies of all sizes in the United States and Canada for work submitted in 38 categories. This year the CMA added a third project budget classification to further narrow down the submissions by dollar amount. CMA members can now submit projects that fall into three project budget categories: Projects Under $25,000; $25,000 &#8211; $50,000 projects; and projects costing more than $50,000.</p>\n<p>All judging is done by CMA members who did not submit any projects for consideration.</p>\n<p><b>Hats off to our visionary clients and partners </b></p>\n<p>Without design-savvy clients, designers, architects and all of the other talented people we partner with on projects, Dark Horse would not have award-worthy work, so we have to share our thanks for this year’s Wood Diamond projects; below are a few details about the work that was recognized.</p>\n<p><b>The Balmoral project</b></p>\n<p><strong><i>First place, Euro Kitchen under $25,000 category</i></strong></p>\n<p>For the Balmoral project, we created a sleek kitchen featuring a bar area with suspended cabinetry above it.

We’ve been fortunate to win Wood Diamond awards every year since we joined; these honors means so much because we know that our fellow cabinet makers truly understand the time and attention to detail that goes into every one of our projects.</p>\n<p>So you can imagine how excited we were when the CMA recognized Dark Horse with four first-place Wood Diamond awards and one third-place award at the CMA awards ceremony in Atlanta last week!</p>\n<p><b>So what is a Wood Diamond Award? </b></p>\n<p>The awards recognize cabinetry companies of all sizes in the United States and Canada for work submitted in 38 categories. This year the CMA added a third project budget classification to further narrow down the submissions by dollar amount. CMA members can now submit projects that fall into three project budget categories: Projects Under $25,000; $25,000 &#8211; $50,000 projects; and projects costing more than $50,000.</p>\n<p>All judging is done by CMA members who did not submit any projects for consideration.</p>\n<p><b>Hats off to our visionary clients and partners </b></p>\n<p>Without design-savvy clients, designers, architects and all of the other talented people we partner with on projects, Dark Horse would not have award-worthy work, so we have to share our thanks for this year’s Wood Diamond projects; below are a few details about the work that was recognized.</p>\n<p><b>The Balmoral project</b></p>\n<p><strong><i>First place, Euro Kitchen under $25,000 category</i></strong></p>\n<p>For the Balmoral project, we created a sleek kitchen featuring a bar area with suspended cabinetry above it.
