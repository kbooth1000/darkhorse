Designers Christy Dillard and Heidi Pearce helped with the overall color schemes (including working around the red oven).</p>\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the main features and details in the new kitchen:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cabinets are transitional, somewhere between modern and Art Deco style, painted with a color called Tapestry Beige. The material is routed MDF.</li>\n<li>The countertops are quartz.</li>\n<li>The idea of having some glass-front cabinet doors was appealing, but that limits what you can store in those cabinets if you want to keep the overall look of your kitchen aesthetically pleasing. To steer clear of that limitation, we went with ribbed glass and put a panel painted the same color as the cabinets behind the glass on the upper cabinets.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The decision to use unusual/retro-style appliances was an important part of the design scheme. Viking offered a double oven in factory red<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>– one of the two ovens has a traditional pull-down door and the other is a French-door style. The placement of the ovens in the corner of the kitchen is a bit unusual, but it’s very effective.\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1655 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=980%2C1307\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"1307\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?w=1224 1224w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=300%2C400 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=1218%2C1624 1218w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=640%2C853 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=980%2C1307 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></li>\n<li>Unfortunately, we could not find a red retro refrigerator to match. Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from the staff at appliance dealer Howard Payne and Co., we found a stainless steel model and took it to an auto body shop where it was painted to match the ovens.</li>\n<li>All appliances were made by Viking, with the exception of the wine fridge, which was made by Jenn-Air.</li>\n<li>The Blum Servo Drive touch-to-open system (a last-minute addition to the budget that was well worth it) is a favorite feature. Only two things in the kitchen require opening: the dishwasher and the wine fridge. In addition to the convenience of the touch-to-open system, the lack of hardware also makes for clean lines.</li>\n<li>The backsplash was created from made-to-order tiles in shades of brown, cream and pale green.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n<li>The pendant lights came from Etsy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n<li>The flooring is porcelain tile.</li>\n<li>There are some other cool features scattered through the kitchen, including a roll-out pantry and a deep drawer with inserts to corral long-handled kitchen utensils.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1656 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=980%2C1307\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"1307\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?w=1224 1224w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=300%2C400 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=1218%2C1624 1218w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=640%2C853 640w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=980%2C1307 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a desk used to sit in the old kitchen, you’ll now find the wine fridge (the one with the “problem” door), a cabinet to hide the microwave, toaster and coffee maker, and big, deep drawers (liquor bottles are tall, after all).</li>\n<li>A 27-inch iMac is mounted in the corner cabinet, which makes it easy to look up/display recipes or stream movies/TV while cooking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reno didn’t increase the square footage of the kitchen, but taking the cabinets all the way up to the ceiling added a lot more storage. The adjacent laundry room also got an update with a new stacking washer-dryer set and new flooring to match the kitchen.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>I also added a small, matching cabinet in the adjacent sitting room (which was converted from a sleeping porch during an earlier reno). This cabinet serves as a bar area and has extra storage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h4><b>The bottom line</b></h4>\n<p>So was it worth it to bring my work home, so to speak, and slog through all of the disruptions and delays?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Absolutely.</p>\n<p>I spend my days giving my clients their dream kitchens, and it’s really satisfying to finally have a dream kitchen waiting at home.</p>\n<p>~ Chris Dehmer</p>\n<p><em>Postscript: Here&#8217;s a photo of the previous kitchen as a reminder of where we started.

Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from the staff at appliance dealer Howard Payne and Co., we found a stainless steel model and took it to an auto body shop where it was painted to match the ovens.</li>\n<li>All appliances were made by Viking, with the exception of the wine fridge, which was made by Jenn-Air.</li>\n<li>The Blum Servo Drive touch-to-open system (a last-minute addition to the budget that was well worth it) is a favorite feature. Only two things in the kitchen require opening: the dishwasher and the wine fridge. In addition to the convenience of the touch-to-open system, the lack of hardware also makes for clean lines.</li>\n<li>The backsplash was created from made-to-order tiles in shades of brown, cream and pale green.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n<li>The pendant lights came from Etsy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n<li>The flooring is porcelain tile.</li>\n<li>There are some other cool features scattered through the kitchen, including a roll-out pantry and a deep drawer with inserts to corral long-handled kitchen utensils.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1656 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=980%2C1307\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"1307\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?w=1224 1224w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=300%2C400 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=1218%2C1624 1218w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=640%2C853 640w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Utensil-drawer.jpg?resize=980%2C1307 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a desk used to sit in the old kitchen, you’ll now find the wine fridge (the one with the “problem” door), a cabinet to hide the microwave, toaster and coffee maker, and big, deep drawers (liquor bottles are tall, after all).</li>\n<li>A 27-inch iMac is mounted in the corner cabinet, which makes it easy to look up/display recipes or stream movies/TV while cooking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reno didn’t increase the square footage of the kitchen, but taking the cabinets all the way up to the ceiling added a lot more storage. The adjacent laundry room also got an update with a new stacking washer-dryer set and new flooring to match the kitchen.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>I also added a small, matching cabinet in the adjacent sitting room (which was converted from a sleeping porch during an earlier reno). This cabinet serves as a bar area and has extra storage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h4><b>The bottom line</b></h4>\n<p>So was it worth it to bring my work home, so to speak, and slog through all of the disruptions and delays?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Absolutely.</p>\n<p>I spend my days giving my clients their dream kitchens, and it’s really satisfying to finally have a dream kitchen waiting at home.</p>\n<p>~ Chris Dehmer</p>\n<p><em>Postscript: Here&#8217;s a photo of the previous kitchen as a reminder of where we started.
