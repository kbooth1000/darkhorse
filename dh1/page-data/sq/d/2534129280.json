But it&#8217;s never too late to take stock, so at this halfway point of 2021, we&#8217;re taking a few paragraphs to look back at 2020. <br><br>When you&#8217;re hit with tough times, I think the best thing you can do is focus on what you&#8217;re grateful for; at Dark Horse, we can honestly say there were quite a few of those things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Back in the summer of 2020, I was honored to be elected to <a href=\"http://darkhorsewoodworks.com/dh1/blog/chris-dehmer-re-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board\">a second term as president </a>of the Cabinet Makers Association’s Board of Directors. In early March 2020, I experienced a first: <a href=\"http://darkhorsewoodworks.com/dh1/blog/a-raucous-meeting-of-the-minds-no-zoom-squares-in-sight\">Presiding over the CMA’s national conference in Illinois.</a> It was great to spend time with friends from across the country and learn from the impressive line-up of speakers that our Executive Director Amanda Conger put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was some talk of COVID as we gathered in Chicago, but none of us dreamed that the country would shut down within days of returning home. Our conference turned out to be the last one I would go to in 2020 due to COVID-related cancellations. But community is the CMA’s mission, so we figured out how to work around the limitations; after all, you need your community most when things get challenging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us hopped on weekly Zoom calls to problem-solve and share ideas about how to rethink our operations. In the fall, we took the presentations that were originally slated for the cancelled International Woodworking Fair, and put them online in a webinar series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carrying on</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Dark Horse, there were challenges, but in the end, we had a banner year. We worked on some great projects that we’ll be sharing on the website, and I’m thankful that we’re getting to do more and more of the work we enjoy most. Soon, we’ll be announcing a new project that I’m excited about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot to be grateful for, and we&#8217;re especially thankful for our clients and collaborators, not to mention the people I think of as “friends of Dark Horse” — those of you who read our posts, look at our latest projects online and generally cheer us on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope the remainder of 2021 is healthy for everyone – in every sense of the word!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Dehmer</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-1778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/year-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-1778\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/year-in-review/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-1778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/year-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","title":"Silver linings","slug":"year-in-review","author":{"node":{"name":"darkhorse"}}}},{"node":{"date":"2020-08-01T19:20:59","content":"<p><div id=\"attachment_1761\" style=\"width: 4042px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1761\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1761\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?resize=980%2C735\" alt=\"IMG_2122\" width=\"980\" height=\"735\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?w=4032 4032w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?resize=400%2C300 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?resize=1624%2C1218 1624w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?resize=640%2C480 640w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?resize=980%2C735 980w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?w=1960 1960w, https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2122.jpg?w=2940 2940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1761\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chris Dehmer <em>(right)</em> with fellow CMA members at the national conference in March</p></div></p>\n<p>The Cabinet Makers Association’s Board of Directors has voted to give Dark Horse Woodworks’ Chris Dehmer a second term as president of the board.

The Members‐at‐Large are Monika Soos of Sofo Kitchens (Maple Ridge, BC), Brian Clancy of Clancy Woodworking (Sherman, CT), and Matt Wehner of Cabinet Concepts by Design (Springfield, MO).</p>\n<p>“It’s an honor to be trusted with another term as president,” Chris says. “We’re in the middle of an unprecedented situation for our country and our industry, and I know the Board is committed to working with Executive Director Amanda Conger to do whatever we can to support our members with ideas and resources, not to mention moral support and encouragement.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>With industry meetings cancelled for the near future, he says it’s going to be important to make the most of the CMA’s forums and other ways to communicate at a distance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>“Industry and CMA events offer such great opportunities to network and get to know other members, and I know I’m going to miss that.

Board members are Ken Kumph, outgoing president Leland Thomasset and former secretary Monika Soos.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>“When I first became involved with the CMA in 2012, Dark Horse Woodworks was still fairly new,&#8221; Chris says. “In the beginning, I appreciated the impact of winning peer-judged awards for our work via the CMA’s annual Wood Diamond Awards. We were proud to be recognized for our work, but the awards were also a great marketing tool for us. It’s powerful for potential clients to see that you’re doing work that is honored by others in the industry.”</p>\n<p>Chris soon took his involvement to a deeper level, attending events, participating in discussions on the online forum<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>and eventually joining the board in 2016.</p>\n<p><b>All-in</b></p>\n<p>Owning a small business is challenging and time-consuming, and taking on outside commitments is no small thing.</p>\n<p>But Chris sees the CMA time commitment and his growing leadership role as wise investments. In his inaugural &#8220;President’s Message&#8221; for the CMA’s quarterly magazine, <i>PROfiles,</i> he explains the value of being part of the community.</p>\n<p>“My involvement with the CMA is the single best professional development opportunity I’ve ever encountered, and being on this board has changed me and my business forever,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;When you start a business, it’s tempting to want to go it alone and to look at the others in your line of work as competition – even if they aren’t literally vying for the same customers, you may see them as competing against you for awards or respect or reputation. That’s not the way it works with the CMA. The best part of being in this group is the ability to draw on the knowledge of other members.”</p>\n<p>The CMA also provided Chris with an opportunity to develop another set of skills: Public speaking and what many in the business world call “thought leadership.” He has spoken at national industry conferences and CMA events about his experiences as a business owner, craftsman and entrepreneur.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>“It’s definitely rewarding to have started out as a novice and to have reached a point where I have knowledge to share with others who are just starting out or who may be changing gears,” he says. “I credit my CMA friends for helping me get to that point by sharing their hard-won expertise with me over the years, and I intend to keep paying it forward whenever I can.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-1696\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-1696\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-1696\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","title":"Chris Dehmer elected President of Cabinet Makers Association Board","slug":"chris-dehmer-elected-president-of-cabinet-makers-association-board","author":{"node":{"name":"darkhorse"}}}},{"node":{"date":"2019-04-03T11:30:32","content":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1652 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kitchen-long-view-CROPPED.jpeg?resize=980%2C1262\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"1262\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kitchen-long-view-CROPPED.jpeg?w=1224 1224w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kitchen-long-view-CROPPED.jpeg?resize=311%2C400 311w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kitchen-long-view-CROPPED.jpeg?resize=1261%2C1624 1261w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kitchen-long-view-CROPPED.jpeg?resize=640%2C824 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kitchen-long-view-CROPPED.jpeg?resize=980%2C1262 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>As promised, Dark Horse is happy to (at last) bring you the final installment of our “Professional cabinetmaker wrestles his own kitchen reno to the ground” story, complete with photos.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in earlier posts, there are distinct pros and cons to doing your own kitchen overhaul.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>The good news is that you’re likely to end up with exactly what you wanted, down to the smallest details.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>The bad news?

Designers Christy Dillard and Heidi Pearce helped with the overall color schemes (including working around the red oven).</p>\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the main features and details in the new kitchen:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cabinets are transitional, somewhere between modern and Art Deco style, painted with a color called Tapestry Beige. The material is routed MDF.</li>\n<li>The countertops are quartz.</li>\n<li>The idea of having some glass-front cabinet doors was appealing, but that limits what you can store in those cabinets if you want to keep the overall look of your kitchen aesthetically pleasing. To steer clear of that limitation, we went with ribbed glass and put a panel painted the same color as the cabinets behind the glass on the upper cabinets.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The decision to use unusual/retro-style appliances was an important part of the design scheme. Viking offered a double oven in factory red<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>– one of the two ovens has a traditional pull-down door and the other is a French-door style. The placement of the ovens in the corner of the kitchen is a bit unusual, but it’s very effective.\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1655 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=980%2C1307\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"1307\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?w=1224 1224w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=300%2C400 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=1218%2C1624 1218w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=640%2C853 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fridge-ovens.jpg?resize=980%2C1307 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></li>\n<li>Unfortunately, we could not find a red retro refrigerator to match.

In baseball, if your manager had to leave the game, you wouldn’t plug in the pitcher, shortstop, etc. to take over; they know their expertise, but without a manager’s big-picture view and experience, it would be pretty hard for them to run the game.</p>\n<p>We have projects to keep on track, and on top of that, I found out that the installation date for one project had to be delayed, a pretty big deal when you’ve been trying to plan your absence right down to the last detail.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></p>\n<p>All that is to say: I’ve been stressed about this surgery.</p>\n<p><b>… until a guardian angel shows up.</b></p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I confided in a friend I’ve gotten to know through my involvement with the Cabinet Makers Association, aka the CMA, over the past few years. He has many more years of experience in the industry, and I often call on him for advice or ideas on challenges I might have on a project.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>I told him I was really concerned about how things were going to hang together while I was out, especially the first few weeks – and especially with the installation schedule change.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>After offering up other suggestions to help ease my mind, he said, “If it comes down to it, Atlanta is a short flight, and I’ll come down and oversee things while you’re out.”</p>\n<p>I was stunned – and sure I must have misunderstood.</p>\n<p>But when I said as much, he said he meant it.</p>\n<p>You know, I don’t often admit to it when something strikes an emotional nerve, but my friend’s offer bowled me over. I’m sure there was a long silence on my end of the line before I could get my wits about me and thank him.</p>\n<p><b>Gifts of all kinds</b></p>\n<p>There are many different kinds of gifts and there are many kinds of gifted people, and my friend has the quality of both generosity and a sincerity that makes it crystal clear that when he offers you a gift, he means it.</p>\n<p>I believe most of us find it hard to admit that we sometimes need help, and it’s even harder to actually follow through and accept that help. I’m pretty sure this kind of stoic attitude is something we all need to try to let go of, because it’s a rare human being who never needs help.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>I’m going to implement his other suggestions and see how that goes before asking him to be away from his business. No matter what happens, this Thanksgiving, I’d like to share my deep gratitude for my friend who is not only willing to take time away from his work, but also go through the hassle of getting on a plane to give me peace of mind.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>I’m thankful for his time and talents, but also for the gift of being made to feel as though his offer was one I should feel just fine about accepting.</p>\n<p>He would never want to be named, but I decided I had to share this story even without his name attached to it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>The Dark Horse team and I wish you a great Thanksgiving and hope that you, too, have a community like the one I’ve become part of with my CMA friends.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-1580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/giving-thanks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-1580\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/giving-thanks/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-1580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/giving-thanks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","title":"Giving thanks","slug":"giving-thanks","author":{"node":{"name":"darkhorse"}}}},{"node":{"date":"2018-10-11T20:00:30","content":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Camaster-.jpg?w=980\" alt=\"Dark Horse Woodworks shop sets up for tour stop.\" class=\"wp-image-1575\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Camaster-.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Camaster-.jpg?resize=400%2C194 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Camaster-.jpg?resize=640%2C311 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Camaster-.jpg?resize=980%2C476 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a great time hosting a Cabinet Makers Association shop tour at Dark Horse just ahead of \nthe\nInternational Woodworkers Fair in Atlanta\nin August.\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nDark\nHorse was the final stop on a three-shop tour – the August 21 tour\nalso included two other Atlanta-area shops, <strong><a href=\"http://atlantacabinets.com/\">Atlanta\nCabinet Shop</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://cabinetsbytom.com/\">Custom\nCreative Furniture</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n<strong>Give\nand take</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nWe\nwere able to show our 50 guests – fellow\nCMA members from all over the country –\nour set-up and the technology we use, and answer questions about how\nwe operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAnd\nas I’d hoped, we also got some feedback and ideas about how we\ncould improve our way of doing things. The ideas ranged from workflow\nsuggestions to little tweaks we could make to save steps (and\ntherefore time) – for instance, shifting the location of an\nassembly table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nWe\nknew our lighting wasn’t great, but we didn’t realize how bad it\nwas until getting several\nquestions\nand comments about it;\nwe’ve\nalready added some additional lighting and plan to add more. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nThe\nmost surprising question during the tour? “Hey, since you don’t\nuse that [fill in the blank] much, can I buy it from you?” It’s\npretty obvious what equipment we don’t use because it’s all\nshoved into one area that’s completely inaccessible unless you move\nother things around. (The answer was always, “Sorry, no.”)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n<strong>Perks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blum.jpg?w=980\" alt=\"Image of Blum sponsorship area.\" class=\"wp-image-1576\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blum.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blum.jpg?resize=400%2C194 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blum.jpg?resize=640%2C311 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blum.jpg?resize=980%2C476 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\nOur\ntour stop was sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.rugbyabp.com\">Rugby\nArchitectural Building Products </a>(which\ndistributes\nplywood,\nspecialty panels, and hardware); <a href=\"https://www.blum.com/us/en/\">Blum</a>\n(hardware manufacturer); <a href=\"http://www.jonesmetalmolding.com\">Jones\nMetal Molding</a>\n(local company that is a distributor for Blum and other cabinet\nhardware); and <a href=\"https://www.camaster.com\">CAMaster</a>,\nthe maker of Dark Horse’s CNC machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sponsor-signs.jpg?w=980\" alt=\"Signs thanking sponsors.\" class=\"wp-image-1577\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sponsor-signs.jpg?w=1083 1083w, https://i2.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sponsor-signs.jpg?resize=400%2C230 400w, https://i2.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sponsor-signs.jpg?resize=640%2C368 640w, https://i2.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sponsor-signs.jpg?resize=980%2C563 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\nThanks\nto Hitachi\nKoki USA,\nthere was a drawing for a Hitachi\npower tool, and Hitachi and Blum offered demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAnd\nto cap off the day, we had some surprise Southern hospitality planned\nfor our guests.
