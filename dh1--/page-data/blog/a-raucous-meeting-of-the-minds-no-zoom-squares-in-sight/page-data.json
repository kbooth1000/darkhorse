So for me, our time registering new arrivals, hauling boxes, chatting at breakfast and lunch, riding the bus to the shop tours and mingling at our cocktail reception and dinner were the highlights.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1764\" style=\"width: 4042px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1764\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1764\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?resize=980%2C735\" alt=\"IMG_2375\" width=\"980\" height=\"735\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?w=4032 4032w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?resize=400%2C300 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?resize=1624%2C1218 1624w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?resize=640%2C480 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?resize=980%2C735 980w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?w=1960 1960w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2375.jpg?w=2940 2940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Enter a caption</p></div></p>\n<p>A lot of us have small shops, and we can go through our workdays only interacting with a few people (or none at all, depending on the day). It’s so great to get these opportunities to spend time with kindred spirits in the industry a few times a year, and I’m really glad that our 2020 Vision gathering squeaked through before the country began shutting down to stop the spread of COVID-19.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Other events, such as the International Woodworking Fair in August, have already been canceled; it’s a pretty big challenge to bring in thousands of people from across the world to a huge venue and feel good about keeping everyone safe and healthy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>It’s disappointing to miss a chance to gather again, but in the meantime, I’m keeping up with Amanda, the other board members and other CMA friends in all of the ways we’re used to connecting between events – Zoom meetings, “Hey, how do I fix [XYZ problem]?” texts and phone calls, and posts on the CMA forums.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1765\" style=\"width: 2711px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1765\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1765\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?resize=980%2C735\" alt=\"IMG_2470\" width=\"980\" height=\"735\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?w=2701 2701w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?resize=400%2C300 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?resize=1624%2C1218 1624w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?resize=640%2C480 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?resize=980%2C735 980w, https://i1.wp.com/www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2470.jpg?w=1960 1960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1765\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Post-conference gathering with friends at the Q Center</p></div></p>\n<p>The great thing about a strong community is that it hangs together even when times get tough, and time and distance stretch on. In a year that has brought quite a few challenges, I’m grateful to be part of such a supportive “village.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>~ Chris Dehmer</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-1759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/a-raucous-meeting-of-the-minds-no-zoom-squares-in-sight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-1759\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/a-raucous-meeting-of-the-minds-no-zoom-squares-in-sight/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-1759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"http://www.atlantavoices.com/dh2/blog/a-raucous-meeting-of-the-minds-no-zoom-squares-in-sight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","author":"darkhorse","title":"A raucous meeting of the minds (no Zoom squares in sight)","id":"cG9zdDoxNzU5","date":"2020-07-01T16:31:10"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
