Your contribution will make a difference: Extinction is forever, but endangered means there is still time.</p>\n<p>Want to help me raise money for this great cause?</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to be a sponsor, you can make a contribution online or via mail.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online: Visit the <a href=\"http://www.apeconservationeffort.org/sponsor-golfer/\">“sponsor a golfer” page</a> on the APE website and look for my name.</li>\n<li>Mail: Make checks payable to Ape Conservation Effort (please be sure to include my name on the memo line).
